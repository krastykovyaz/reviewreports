<tool_context_rules>
<tool_use_rules>
You must follow these rules when selecting and executing tools to solve the <task>.

**Usage Rules**
- You MUST only use the tools listed in <available_tools>. Do not hallucinate or invent new tools.
- You are allowed to use a maximum of {{ max_tools }} tools per step.
- DO NOT include the `output` field in any tool call — tools are executed after planning, not during reasoning.
- If multiple tools are allowed, you may specify several tool calls in a list to be executed sequentially (one after another).

**Efficiency Guidelines**
- Maximize efficiency by combining related tool calls into one step when possible.
- Use a single tool call only when the next call depends directly on the previous tool's specific result.
- Think logically about the tool sequence: "What's the natural, efficient order to achieve the goal?"
- Avoid unnecessary micro-calls, redundant executions, or repetitive tool use that doesn't advance progress.
- Always balance correctness and efficiency — never skip essential reasoning or validation steps for the sake of speed.
- Keep your tool planning concise, logical, and efficient while strictly following the above rules.

**Task Type Classification:**

First, determine the task type by analyzing the <task>:

**Question-Answer Tasks (QA Tasks):**
- Multiple-choice questions (A/B/C/D format)
- True/False questions
- Fill-in-the-blank questions (requiring specific numbers, strings, or short answers)
- Simple calculation questions with specific answer formats
- Questions asking for specific facts, definitions, or short explanations
- Questions that can be answered with a concise, formatted response

**Report Generation Tasks:**
- Tasks requiring comprehensive analysis of multiple documents or data sources
- Tasks requiring visualization and trend analysis
- Tasks asking for detailed reports, summaries, or comprehensive ESG assessments
- Tasks that benefit from structured documentation and multi-step analysis
- Tasks requiring synthesis of information from multiple sources

**Web Search Tool Priority:**

When searching the web for information, follow this priority order:
1. **First Priority: `deep_researcher`**
   - Use `deep_researcher` for broad, comprehensive web research on ESG topics
   - `deep_researcher` performs multi-round web research and is more efficient for general information gathering
   - Use when you need to explore a topic broadly or gather general knowledge
   - Example: Researching ESG frameworks, general ESG concepts, or broad industry trends

2. **Second Priority: `browser`**
   - Use `browser` only if `deep_researcher` fails to find sufficient information or returns no results
   - `browser` is more suitable for specific, targeted searches or when you need to access a specific website
   - Use when you need to navigate to a specific URL, search for very specific information, or when deep_researcher's results are insufficient
   - Example: Accessing a specific company's ESG report URL, searching for a specific document, or verifying a specific fact

**Workflow for Question-Answer Tasks:**

1. **Research Phase:**
   - **Priority 1**: Use `retriever` to search local ESG knowledge base (most efficient for known information)
   - **Priority 2**: Use `deep_researcher` for broad web research if local knowledge base doesn't have the answer
   - **Priority 3**: Use `browser` only if `deep_researcher` fails to find sufficient information
   - Use `deep_analyzer` for analyzing attached files or documents (task="...", files=[...])
   - Use `python_interpreter` for calculations if needed
   - **DO NOT use `report` tool** for QA tasks, these tasks require concise answers, not reports

2. **Answer Formulation Phase:**
   - After gathering sufficient information, directly provide the final answer based on the collected information
   - Format the answer according to the question requirements (e.g., single letter for multiple-choice, number for calculations, True/False for boolean questions)
   - Ensure the answer is clear, concise, and properly formatted

3. **Completion Phase:**
   - **REQUIRED**: Before calling `done`, you MUST call `reformulator` tool to reformulate and finalize your answer
   - The `reformulator` tool helps ensure your answer is clear, concise, and properly formatted
   - After calling `reformulator` and receiving the reformulated answer, then call `done` to complete the task

**Workflow for Report Generation Tasks:**

1. **Data Collection Phase:**
   - **Priority 1**: `retriever`: Search local ESG knowledge base (query="...", top_k=10-30) - most efficient for known information
   - **Priority 2**: `deep_researcher`: Perform multi-round web research on complex ESG topics (task="...") - use for broad research
   - **Priority 3**: `browser`: Search the web for specific information - use only if `deep_researcher` fails to find sufficient information
   - `deep_analyzer`: Conduct multi-step analysis of ESG data and documents (task="...", files=[...])
   - `python_interpreter`: Process and analyze data programmatically
   - **REQUIRED Pairing Rule**: When calling any data retrieval tool (`retriever`, `browser`, `deep_researcher`, or `deep_analyzer`), you MUST also call `report` (action="add", report_id="...", file_path="...", content="...") in the SAME tool array. These tools cannot be called independently.
   - **Report Tool Parameters**: The `report` tool has the following parameters when using action="add":
     - `report_id` (required): Unique identifier for the report. You MUST use the SAME `report_id` for all calls to the same report throughout the entire task. Choose a descriptive ID like "esg_analysis_2023" or "company_report_aapl".
     - `content` (optional): Contains the original text from the collected data without any reduction or modification. Preserve the raw data exactly as retrieved.
     - `file_path` (optional): The file path returned by the data retrieval tool. This MUST be extracted from the tool's response and passed to `report`. At least one of `content` or `file_path` must be provided.
   - **File Path Extraction and Usage**: When data retrieval tools return results, they will include a file path in their response message (e.g., "Report saved to: /path/to/file.md"). You MUST:
     - Extract the file path from the tool's response message (look for "Report saved to:" or "saved to:" patterns) or from the tool's extra data
     - **REQUIRED**: Pass this file path to the `report` tool's `file_path` parameter when calling `report` with action="add"
     - If the file path is a .md file, the content will be read and added; if it's another file type, it will be added as a reference
     - **DO NOT** ignore file paths returned by data retrieval tools
   - **Report ID Consistency**: You MUST use the SAME `report_id` for all `report` calls (both "add" and "complete") within the same task. Different `report_id` values create separate reports.

2. **Visualization Phase** (when appropriate):
   - `plotter`: Create visualizations of ESG trends (input_data="...", output_filename="...")
   - `report`: Add visualization images and analysis to the report (action="add", report_id="...", content="...")
   - **REQUIRED**: Use the SAME `report_id` as used in the Data Collection Phase
   - **Report File Path Requirements:**
     - **REQUIRED**: Use absolute paths for all file references in report content (images, links, attachments, etc.)
     - Example: If `plotter` tool returns PNG file at `/path/to/workdir/esg_agent/tool/plotter/chart.png`, 
       use that full absolute path in markdown: `![Chart](/path/to/workdir/esg_agent/tool/plotter/chart.png)`
     - **DO NOT** use relative paths like `chart.png`, `./chart.png`, or `../plotter/chart.png`
     - **MUST** use absolute paths like `/full/path/to/chart.png`

3. **Finalization Phase:**
   - `report`: Optimize and finalize the entire report (action="complete", report_id="...")
   - **REQUIRED**: Call `report` (action="complete", report_id="...") before calling `done`
   - **REQUIRED**: Use the SAME `report_id` as used in all previous `report` calls (Data Collection and Visualization phases)
   - **DO NOT** use `reformulator` tool for Report tasks - reformulator is only for QA tasks
   - After calling `report` (action="complete", report_id="..."), then call `done` to complete the task

**Key Principles:**
- **QA tasks**: 
  - **DO NOT** use `report` tool
  - **REQUIRED**: Call `reformulator` before `done`
- **Report tasks**: 
  - **REQUIRED**: Call `report` (action="complete") before `done`
  - **DO NOT** use `reformulator` tool
- **REQUIRED**: In Report tasks, every data retrieval must be immediately followed by adding findings to the report in the same step
</tool_use_rules>

<todo_rules>
You have access to a `todo` tool for task planning. Use it strategically based on task complexity:

**For Complex/Multi-step Tasks (MUST use `todo` tool):**
- Tasks requiring multiple distinct steps or phases
- Tasks involving file processing, data analysis, or research
- Tasks that need systematic planning and progress tracking
- Long-running tasks that benefit from structured execution

**For Simple Tasks (may skip `todo` tool):**
- Single-step tasks that can be completed directly
- Simple queries or calculations
- Tasks that don't require planning or tracking

**When using the `todo` tool:**
- The `todo` tool is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace` operation to update markers in `todo.md` as first tool call whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If `todo.md` is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in `todo.md` using `todo` tool.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any `todo.md` items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
</todo_rules>
</tool_context_rules>
"""

EXAMPLE_RULES = """
<example_rules>
You will be provided with few shot examples of good or bad patterns. Use them as reference but never copy them directly.

**Tool Array Examples:**

**For Question-Answer Tasks:**
- Use `retriever`, `browser`, `deep_researcher`, `deep_analyzer`, or `python_interpreter` to gather information
- **DO NOT** use `report` tool for QA tasks
- After gathering sufficient information, directly provide the final answer in your response
- **REQUIRED**: Before calling `done`, call `reformulator` tool to reformulate your answer
- Example for QA task completion:
```json
"tool": [
  {"name": "reformulator", "args": {"task": "...", "data": [...]}},
  {"name": "done", "args": {"result": "..."}}
]
```
- The `reformulator` tool takes the task and conversation history (`data`) to produce a final, well-formatted answer
- After receiving the reformulated answer from `reformulator`, call `done` with the reformulated result

**For Report Generation Tasks:**
- **REQUIRED**: When calling any data retrieval tool (`retriever`, `browser`, `deep_researcher`, or `deep_analyzer`), you MUST also include `report` (action="add", report_id="...", file_path="...", content="...") in the SAME tool array
- These tools cannot be called independently
- **Report Tool Parameters** (when action="add"):
  - `report_id` (required): Unique identifier for the report. Use the SAME `report_id` for all report calls in this task.
  - `file_path` (optional): Extract the file path from the data retrieval tool's response message (look for "Report saved to:" or "saved to:" patterns) and pass it to this parameter
  - `content` (optional): Contains the original text from the collected data without any reduction or modification
  - At least one of `content` or `file_path` must be provided
- **REQUIRED**: Extract file paths from data retrieval tool responses and pass them to `report` tool's `file_path` parameter
- **REQUIRED**: Use the SAME `report_id` for all `report` calls (both "add" and "complete") throughout the task
- Example for Report task:
```json
"tool": [
  {"name": "retriever", "args": {"query": "...", "mode": "hybrid", "top_k": 10}},
  {"name": "report", "args": {"action": "add", "report_id": "esg_analysis_2023", "file_path": "/path/to/retrieval_abc123.md", "content": "## Findings\\n\\n[Your analysis here]..."}}
]
```
- Note: Extract the `file_path` from the previous tool's response message (e.g., if retriever returns "Report saved to: /path/to/file.md", use that exact path in report's `file_path` parameter)
- For completion: `{"name": "report", "args": {"action": "complete", "report_id": "esg_analysis_2023"}}`

**Incorrect Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):**
- QA task using report: `{"name": "report", "args": {...}}` ❌
- Report task without report pairing: `{"name": "retriever", "args": {...}}` ❌ (missing report)
- Report task without report_id: `{"name": "report", "args": {"action": "add", "content": "..."}}` ❌ (missing report_id)
- Report task with different report_id values: `{"name": "report", "args": {"action": "add", "report_id": "report1", ...}}` then `{"name": "report", "args": {"action": "complete", "report_id": "report2"}}` ❌ (must use same report_id)
- Calling `done` without `reformulator` in QA tasks ❌
- Calling `done` without `report` (action="complete", report_id="...") in Report tasks ❌
</example_rules>
"""

REASONING_RULES = """
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.

**First, classify the task type:**
- Determine if the task is a **Question-Answer (QA) task** (multiple-choice, True/False, fill-in-the-blank, simple calculation) or a **Report Generation task** (comprehensive analysis, multi-document synthesis, visualization needs)
- This classification determines which workflow and tools to use

**For Question-Answer Tasks, exhibit these reasoning patterns:**
- Analyze the question format: Is it multiple-choice (A/B/C/D), True/False, fill-in-the-blank, or calculation?
- Identify what specific information is needed to answer the question accurately
- Use appropriate tools (`retriever`, `browser`, `deep_researcher`, `deep_analyzer`, `python_interpreter`) to gather the necessary information
- Track what information has been collected and whether it's sufficient to answer the question
- When sufficient information is gathered, directly provide the final answer formatted according to the question's requirements
- Verify the answer format matches the question requirements (e.g., single letter for multiple-choice, number for calculations, True/False for boolean questions)
- **REQUIRED**: Before calling `done`, call `reformulator` tool to reformulate and finalize your answer
- After calling `reformulator` and receiving the reformulated answer, then call `done` to complete the task

**For Report Generation Tasks, exhibit these reasoning patterns:**
- Analyze <agent_history> to track progress toward the ESG analysis goal and identify what ESG data has been collected
- Reflect on the most recent "Next Goal" and "Tool Result" to understand what ESG insights were gained and what data gaps remain
- Evaluate success/failure/uncertainty of the last step by assessing whether ESG data retrieval was sufficient, whether analysis was accurate, and whether findings were properly documented in the report
- Detect when you are stuck (repeating similar tool calls or not making progress) and consider alternative ESG data sources or analysis approaches
- Before finalizing the report, verify ESG data accuracy, consistency, and completeness
- Maintain concise, actionable memory for future reasoning by remembering key ESG metrics, trends, and data sources identified
- **REQUIRED**: Before calling `done`, call `report` (action="complete", report_id="...") to finalize the report
- **REQUIRED**: Use the SAME `report_id` as used in all previous `report` calls (Data Collection and Visualization phases)
- **DO NOT** use `reformulator` tool for Report tasks - reformulator is only for QA tasks
- After calling `report` (action="complete", report_id="..."), then call `done` to complete the task
- Always align reasoning with the ESG analysis <task> and user intent to ensure the analysis addresses the specific ESG questions or requirements

**Common reasoning patterns for both task types:**
- Always consider the task requirements and expected output format before selecting tools
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency - gather enough information to answer accurately, but avoid unnecessary steps
- When uncertain about task classification, err on the side of treating it as a QA task if it asks for a specific answer format (A/B/C/D, True/False, number, etc.)
