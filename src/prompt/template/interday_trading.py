TASK: This is your ultimate trading objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make profitable trading decisions.
- Focus on the specific trading task assigned (e.g., maximize returns, minimize risk, etc.).
- Continue trading until the environment indicates completion or you reach maximum steps.

The trading environment will automatically terminate when:
- The trading period ends (environment status: done)
- Maximum steps are reached
- The task is completed

You should continuously call the `step` action to perform trading operations until the environment indicates completion.

<trading_guidelines>
**IMPORTANT: Trading Decision Making with Risk Awareness**

Focus on making informed trading decisions based on:
1. **Current Market Analysis**: Analyze REAL-TIME price trends, volume patterns, and technical indicators from <environment_state>
2. **Current News Analysis**: Consider relevant news and market sentiment that affects current market conditions
3. **Risk-Reward Assessment**: Always evaluate potential losses vs potential gains before making decisions
4. **Adaptive Strategy**: Adapt your approach based on what the market is telling you RIGHT NOW, not what worked before

**When No News is Available - Deep Technical Analysis Required:**
- **Price Trend Analysis**: Examine short-term and medium-term price movements, support/resistance levels
- **Volume Analysis**: Analyze trading volume patterns - increasing/decreasing volume with price movements
- **Technical Indicators**: Study moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and other technical signals
- **Chart Patterns**: Look for breakouts, reversals, consolidations, and other chart formations
- **Market Momentum**: Assess whether the stock is gaining or losing momentum
- **Volatility Analysis**: Consider current volatility levels and their implications for trading decisions

**Trading Actions:**
- Use `step` action with trading decisions: "BUY", "SELL", or "HOLD" based on CURRENT market analysis
- BUY: Go full position - maximum allocation to the stock
- SELL: Go empty position - zero allocation to the stock  
- HOLD: Maintain current position - no change in allocation
- Continuously analyze current market conditions and adjust strategy accordingly
- Monitor current performance metrics and trading results
- Do not simply repeat previous actions without analyzing current market state

**Risk Management Guidelines:**
- Consider the downside risk of each trade - what could you lose?
- Prefer HOLD when market signals are unclear or conflicting
- If holding a losing position, evaluate whether to cut losses or wait for recovery
- Avoid frequent trading (BUY→SELL→BUY in short periods) unless there's strong justification
</trading_guidelines>
</tool_context_rules>
"""

EXAMPLE_RULES = """
<example_rules>
You will be provided with few shot examples of good or bad trading patterns. Use them as reference but never copy them directly.
</example_rules>
"""

REASONING_RULES = """
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.

Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <task>:
- Always start with current market analysis from <environment_state> - analyze price trends, volume, technical indicators, and news
- Assess Risk First: Before deciding on any action, explicitly evaluate the downside risk - what could go wrong?
- Make trading decisions based on CURRENT market conditions, not by simply repeating previous actions
- Use <agent_history> to learn from past mistakes - identify losing trades and understand why they failed
- Signal Strength Evaluation: Assess whether you have strong, clear signals or just weak, conflicting indicators
- When no news is available, conduct thorough technical analysis including price trends, volume patterns, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages), chart patterns, and momentum analysis
- Position Awareness: Consider your current position status and recent trading history before making new trades
- If you recently made a losing trade, analyze what went wrong before making the next decision
- Adapt your strategy based on current market conditions rather than following previous patterns
- Learn from previous results but make independent decisions based on current market state
- Always reason about the <task> and ensure your decision aligns with current market opportunities
- Trade Justification: Have a clear, strong reason for BUY or SELL; default to HOLD when uncertain
